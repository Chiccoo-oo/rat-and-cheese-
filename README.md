# Rat in a Maze problem 
**Overview**
The Rat in a Maze problem is a classic puzzle where a rat needs to find its way from the starting point to the destination in a maze. 
The rat can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right, and it cannot move through walls or obstacles.
This project provides a Python implementation to solve the Rat in a Maze problem using both backtracking and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.

## Problem Statement 
There will be a maze of size nxn, with walls at random position with random shape. The source will be at the top left, and the destination will be at the bottom right.
*Task*
The task is to find the cheese which is at the destination from the source.
**Priority to move**
right -> down -> left -> up
**Data-Structure Used:**
Stack(Linked list)
> In this, stack is implemented using list(append and pop)

**Traversal Method:**
Depth First Search(DFS)

**Modules Used**

* Time

* Numpy

* Termcolor

* **Gui Modules**

    * Tkinter

    * Pillow
